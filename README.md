Compile to JavaScript:

```bash
tsc <filename>.ts -w
# automatically compiles this to a file with the same name but with a .js extension
# -w flag watches for changes and recompiles
```

## Getting started

```bash
tsc --init
```

This will create a `tsconfig.json` file which is a configuration file for TypeScript.

Now you only need to run `tsc -w` to compile all TypeScript files in the project.
